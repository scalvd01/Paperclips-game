  "availableFundsInfo": "Your <strong>Available Funds</strong> are shown in the first line of the Business section, and are given in dollar amounts. These funds are used to buy various things ingame.<br /> Funds are generated by selling your paperclips (See Public Demand, Price Per Clip, Marketing).",
  "unsoldInventoryInfo": "<strong>Unsold inventory</strong> is the number of clips you have manufactured that exceed demand. It is useful to have it high enough to be able to see if the number is going up or down, and adjust accordingly. When the Price per Clip is too high, the stock will go up, and when it is low, the stock will go down.",
  "pricePerClipInfo": "<strong>Price Per Clip</strong> is just what it sounds like. You can lower or raise your prices with the two buttons behind this metric, changing the price by $0.01 each click. Your price point has an inverse relationship with Public Demand -- the more expensive the clip, the harder it is to get paid for it, so if your production exceeds your sales you will pile up Unsold inventory.",
  "publicDemandInfo": "The <strong>Public Demand</strong> metric will determine how attractive your offering is to the public, and thus how low you have to decrease your prices to maintain a positive revenue stream. The opposite is also true. This metric can be changed through Marketing, though reducing the price will always increase while increasing the price will always decrease the attractiveness value.<br />Keep in mind that Public Demand can be raised above 100%. It's just a metric of how fast are your paperclips are selling.",
  "marketingInfo": "<strong>Marketing</strong> is a leveled metric that affects how the public views your product, and how likely they are to purchase it (See: Public Demand).<br />The cost of the first level is $100. Marketing can be increased for exponentially increasing cost, with diminishing returns - each new level will be twice the cost of the previous level.",
  "wireInfo": "<strong>Wire</strong> is the primary resource by which all paperclips are generated from. Cost of wire which is indicated on the screen refers to one spool (Initially 1000 inches).<br />The cost of each spool of wire is variable.",
  "autoClippersInfo": "<strong>Auto Clippers</strong> are automated clipping systems that will generate paperclips for sale automatically.",
  "researchLevelInfo": "<strong>Research level</strong> governs how many processors and memory you have, which in turn govern the rate of operation/creativity generation per second and how many maximum operations are available at a given time(respectively). Research level is gained through projects or paperclip number.",
  "processorsInfo": "<strong>Processors</strong> determine the speed at which Operations and, therefore, Projects are completed. Each processor generates 10 operations per second, and generates Creativity. Processors can be purchased with research levels.",
  "memoryInfo": "<strong>Memory</strong> is the limitation of max operations. As memory increases so too does the amount of available operations, by 1.000 operations per memory unit.",
  "operationsInfo": "<strong>Operations</strong> are the amount of available and used processing power for various Projects. The maximum amount of Operations you can have stored is based on the amount of Memory you've purchased. It is increased by having Processors; the more Processors you have the faster it increases.",
  "creativityInfo": "<strong>Creativity</strong> is a resource that is used to complete Projects. It only increases when Processors have finished creating the maximum available Operations in memory, at which point the remaining Operations cycles are used to create Creativity. More processors increase Creativity quicker.",
